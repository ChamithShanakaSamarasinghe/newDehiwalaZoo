                    <p>The girrafes aren't the only ones having a good time at the zoo. You can also pass the time by interacting with the friendly lions, which you can pet and provide food to. Small children may also interact with the baby lions, but only under the supervision of our lion tamers, who were in charge of both the adults and the babies. This activity will take place between 3 and 5 p.m. The following are the charges: Adults pay 700 ruppees, while children pay 350 ruppees.</p>
