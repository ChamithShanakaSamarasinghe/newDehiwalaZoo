        <h1>Why choose us</h1><br>
        <h4>One of Asia's oldest zoological gardens is Dehiwala Zoological Garden. It features a large collection of animals from all around the world. It is accessible by public transit and is open all year. The existence of an aquarium, walk-through aviary, reptile house, butterfly garden, and several small, decaying cages and enclosures harboring famished, bored animals living in prison-like conditions demonstrates the zoo's diversity.</h4>

                        <li>Because of the color of their fur, white Bengal tigers stand out. The lack of the pigment pheomelanin, which is prevalent in Bengal tigers with orange fur, causes the white fur. White Bengal tigers develop faster and heavier than orange Bengal tigers when compared to Bengal tigers. They are also slightly larger at birth and as fully grown adults. When white Bengal tigers are 2â€“3 years old, they are completely matured.</li>

                        <li>Shrub and vine refer to a plant's growth habit rather than a taxonomic classification. Because of their visible efforts to find support for their thin stems, vines are one of the easiest to distinguish of the two. Shrubs, on the other hand, can readily be mistaken for trees with careful pruning. Shrubs are multi-stemmed woody plants that grow shorter than trees, according to botany. Plants classified as shrubs can grow as tall as trees depending on their growing conditions. Scrub or shrubland are habitats that are largely made up of shrub-like plants and are classed according to how dense the vegetation cover is. A closed-scrub ecology, for example, has denser foliage than an open-scrub ecosystem.</li>
                        <li>Plants are usually thought of as being immobile, but vines may "move" by sending out branches, coils, and tendrils to take hold of whatever is available, then filling out leaves and stems in that direction. The vine's searching tip is sensitive, but after it has found a good anchor point, the stem thickens and toughens, in some cases fully enclosing the support.</li>

                <p>The Sri Lankan lion (Panthera leo sinhaleyus), sometimes known as the Ceylonese lion, is a prehistoric lion that was discovered in Sri Lanka. It is thought to have gone extinct around 37,000 years ago, before the appearance of culturally sophisticated humans. Only two teeth from this lion have been discovered in Kuruwita deposits. P. Deraniyagala proposed this subspecies in 1939 based on these teeth.</p>

Visitors are immediately captivated by a troop of Chapman's Zebras at the zoo's entrance. Visitors take advantage of the opportunity to pose for a snapshot in front of the zebra enclosure, where they can observe the Zebra family galloping, jumping, and feeding.</p>
